# assemblyCode
A couple programs written in pure assembly code.

multiplier.as is an assembly program that uses bit-shifting to multiply two simple numbers together.

combination_recursion.as is a bit more complicated. It utilizes stack pointers to recursively compute Combination(n, r).

This is written in a made up assembly language exclusively used in EECS 370 at the University of Michigan, but strongly resembles characteristics of ARMv8
